# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Neural Network Mini-hackathon Fashion MNIST 👗👔

## Goal

Create the highest scoring model to classify clothing images! 

## Instructions

Working rogether in your group, prepare your data, create and train your model, and evaluate it. The training data is [fashion-mnist_train.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist?select=fashion-mnist_train.csv).

- Use Tensorflow Keras.
- Try to use a GPU Accelerator to speed up your training! 🚀
- There are lots of model architectures and hyperparameters you can tune. See what gives you the best validation score.

Then create predictions for the [test set](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist?select=fashion-mnist_test.csv). The predictions should be numbers in the range 0-9. DROP THE LABEL COLUMN FIRST! ⚠

- Do NOT use other people's Kaggle Kernels.

- Hint: create a simple model that trains fast before training more complicated models.

- Feel free to create a confusion matrix to see how your model performs on different articles of clothing.

- If you have time, you might want to try CNNs, data augmentation, and/or transfer learning to make a better model.

- Your deliverables include a repository of your work, as well as a README. You will also give a lightning presentation outlining your group's process/ conclusions/ difficulties.

### Lightning presentations

Right after lunch we'll reconvene and your group will do a brief walk-through with a slide deck of your best model. Assume the audience here is your classmates and instructors.
    
### Roles

- As always, one person should share their screen so the group can work together (everyone should work on their own notebook, too). If you don't usually share your screen, today is a good day to do so. 
- We should hear from each group member during the presentation.

### The dataset
From Kaggle:

> Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images—consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

> The original MNIST dataset contains a lot of handwritten digits. Members of the AI/ML/Data Science community love this dataset and use it as a benchmark to validate their algorithms. In fact, MNIST is often the first dataset researchers try. "If it doesn't work on MNIST, it won't work at all", they said. "Well, if it does work on MNIST, it may still fail on others."
